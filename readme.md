Shared-Plot-Poles v1.0<br>
Written by Rosska85<br><br>

I put this together so my friends and I could all build around the same plot pole. It was annoying that we kept having to destroy each other's plot poles if the person who placed it was offline.<br><br>

Installation
============
**Standard EPOCH**<br>
[Instructions found here] (https://github.com/khamseen/SharedPlotPoles/blob/master/Vanil_Epoch.md)<br>
**If you're running Plot for Life**<br>
[Instructions found here] (https://github.com/khamseen/SharedPlotPoles/blob/master/P4L_Epoch.md)<br><br>

Features
========
- Allows the owner to add other players to the plot pole so the player no longer needs to be online for their friend to build at their plot
- Added players can add other players to the plot pole
- Added players can remove other players from the plot pole (**if using Plot for Life, owner cannot be removed**)
- Added players can upgrade all objects in range of the plot pole
- Added players can build anything inside of the plot pole radius (except other plot poles obviously)
- Added players can remove any object inside the plot pole radius
- (**Non Plot for Life Version Only**) Player can add their own UID to the plot pole when they first build it so they don't lose access if they die
